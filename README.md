# GeoQuest 
![alt text](app/src/main/geoquest_icon-playstore.png)

**GeoQuest** is an Android application built with **Jetpack Compose**, **Firebase**, and the **Google Maps API** that allows users to create, view, and share locations on a shared interactive map.  

Users can save key locations with a name, description, and image, and choose whether to make them **public** (visible to everyone) or **private** (visible only to themselves).

All data is securely stored and synchronized using **Firebase Firestore**, user authentication is managed via **Google Sign-In** and using **Firebase Authentication**.

GeoQuest’s goal is to combine location tracking, social sharing, and gamified exploration into one engaging experience that helps users discover and connect with interesting places around them.
